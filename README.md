# Introduction

Just another _hackathon_  ~~project~~ of mine (_as usual_) for our discord server.

Which means, this contains _very very very_  rushy stuff and stupid hacks _breaking the laws of the lang_  (_I'm afraid_).

This bot does not use any traditional database structure because I'm too lazy to learn how to programmaticaly operate such a database.

So I made my own sluggish _flat file database_  implementation.

Funny, right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  ?

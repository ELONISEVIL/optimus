# Introduction

Just another _hackathon_  ~~project~~ of mine (_as usual_) for our(supremegamers) discord server and Gitpod's discord server.


Which means, this contains _very very very_  rushy stuff and stupid hacks _breaking the laws of the lang_  (_I'm afraid, given that I only know 1% of rustlang, gotta spend some time learning it_).

This bot does not use any traditional database structure because I'm too lazy to learn how to programmatically operate such a database.

So I made my own sluggish _flat file database_  implementation.

Funny, right ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  ?

So if you want to take a peek at my noobish code, you can simply open it on Gitpod and get over this mess within seconds :')
